# Simple OpenAPI Usage
The diagram below shows the simplest way to start using Saxo's OpenAPI.


## Field Groups
<OD description={description} code={code}/>

## Finding the first available sample
The ChartInfo group includes a <code>FirstSampleTime</code> field. This provides the time of the very first sample. Having this information is often useful if you want to show a chart with a horizontal slider at the bottom, and you want to give that slider the correct approximate length even if you do not want to initially fetch all of the chart samples.

## Typical usage - Request/Response
The most common usage of the chart endpoint in a request/response mode is as follows:

First make a simple get request specifying <code>AssetType</code>, Uic, Horizon and all field groups. This will return:
ChartInfo holds various convenience information which applies for all samples on the specified instrument/horizon
DisplayAndFormat holds information about how to format the prices in the samples.
Data includes the most recent 100 samples up to current time.
A DataVersion (see later)
Then, at regular intervals make requests specifying AssetType, Uic, Horizon and:
Mode=From
Time= the value of the most recent sample, which you have in your Data array.
The Data array will now include "all" samples which exist from or after the specified time. Often this will just be a single sample.
